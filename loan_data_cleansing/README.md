## Pre-requisites
	
	Python packages : h5py (2.7.1)
	
## Instructions

1. Get the data from the website "https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data/data". Get the file "loan.csv" file and place the file the .data/ repository.

2. The data preprocessing such as handling missing values, removing outliers and getting inference on the variables are need to be done. Execute the below command:

	$ python main.py
	
The above command, does all the preprocessing of the data and saves the neural network model.

3. After executing the above command, if you want to use the new model what which was created move the files namely, "neural_net_model.h5" and "neural_net_model.json" to the folder "loan_data_prediction_using_tensorflow". 

4. Right now there will be a pre built neural network model in the folder "loan_data_prediction_using_tensorflow". One can use that model, or you can move this and follow the README.md available in the folder "loan_data_prediction_using_tensorflow".
